			`Out in the black it can be difficult to know exactly what you're looking at from sensors alone - but even on radar there's no mistaking that something savage has happened to one of the vessels on your scanner. No longer a single contiguous piece of metal, the hull's been blown out in parts, leaving a comet-like wake of debris that scatters across the void behind the derelict freighter. The fore-end of the ship seems to've fared better than the rear, if the thin jets of atmosphere lancing out from perforations in the hull and sending the entire assembly into a gentle spin are anything to judge by - it's certainly a gentler sort of damage than the variety that would lead to immediate decompression.`

			`Velocity matched and airlocks aligned, the derelict prow's rotation finally comes to an end as your ship clamps on and provides opposing thrust to halt its aimless spinning.`

			`	You lean in to inspect the airlock's computer. Just because the lights are on and there's atmosphere on the other side doesn't mean it isn't full of toxic fumes. Your first query-press prompts an electronic ping, then a dull, metallic knock. That's... Not a sound you've ever heard this particular computer make before.`
			`	And it's certainly never produced speech. It's muffled, but someone appears to be alive and screaming on the other side of the airlock."`

			`	"What are you waiting for? Help me, I've sealed most of the leaks but this ship isn't long for the world!" There's somebody on the other side of the airlock! Peering through the reinforced window brings you face to face with a wild-eyed middle aged man, a burgundy-stained bandage wrapped across his brow and a makeshift sling supporting one arm. Bloody knuckles impact your airlock door, again the knock sounds - weaker this time.`

			`	The airlock slides open with the gentle hiss of mostly-equal atmospheres evening out, then the shuffle of fabric as the man on the other side raises his hands over his head with painstaking slowness. "Look, the last batch of pirates already cleaned me out, all I've got to bargain with is my life and the clothes on my back, so if you're really insisting..."`
			choice
				`	"Relax, friend. You know it's better to be safe than sorry out here. You can put your hands down and tell me what happened here."`

			`	Relief flashes across the survivor's face. "Good. Let's get out of here, but there's something I need to get first. See, the pirates, I thought they were the ambush the dispatcher warned me about, but they were just in the right place at the right time. I'd just stocked up on industrial equipment to sell off at the end of this leg, they took that and were satisfied. Left me with what I was really carrying."`
			`	The man falls to his knees, a bit harder than what looks strictly comfortable, and starts jamming his fingernails into a seam between deck plates. Grunts of exertion fade into an exasperated sigh. "Come on then, help me wrench this open - I'm no good with this bum arm. The deadline to deliver this is ticking away - I'll give you a cut if we make it, yeah?"`
