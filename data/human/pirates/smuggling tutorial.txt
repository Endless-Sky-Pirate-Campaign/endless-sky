# We can merge this into the main smuggling/jobs/what-have-you .txt when it's done. Until then I'll keep it seperate for the sake of keeping it easy to edit.

# The flow is as follows:
#	1) You meet a smuggler who's down on his luck, and he asks for your help in delivering an illegal cargo
#	to Sleezy Ed's, as he owes Ed a great debt and is deathly afraid of winding up on the wrong side of the
#	otherwise jovial ship salesman.
#	While setting up for the journey (carrying a modest mission cargo), the smuggler suggests a few methods
#	for evading scans: Stay towards the fringes and carry a good amount of legal cargo to confuse police.
#	Ideally we'll have some code implemented that makes getting caught based on a ratio of legal:illegal
#	cargo carried.


#	2) Upon arriving at Sleezy Ed's you listen in on a conversation between the smuggler and Ed. He's off 
#	the hook, but still without a ship - so he asks for a ride to Copperline Station, where he has some
#	friends who'll get him running rum until he can afford to get his original ship restored.
#	In return, he'll show you some secret and help you make some profit running stolen ship parts to  Cprlne.

#	3) A waypoint is generated in an empty or modestly-patrolled system between your destination (Copperline)
#	and Sleezy Ed's. It was formerly a non-landable object, but now allows you to land and refuel from a
#	cache maintained by the smuggler's buddies. Upon landing you have a chance to talk to the smuggler and 
#	learn something about his history, about the rumrunners at Copperline, and about Ed's scrapyard.

#	4) Drop the smuggler off at Copperline and sell the stolen ship parts you picked up at Ed's. Tutorial
#	complete!

			`No spaceport is complete without somebody in dire straits asking passerby for help. This time the beggar is - from what you can see that isn't concealed by bandages - a young man, what of his skin remains visible marked by a painful looking pattern of burns. Both hands and the entire right half of his head are wound in bandages, and his entire body carries a strong odor of disinfectants and salve; not strictly unpleasant, but still bordering on the overpowering.`

Best case you help me and I get my life back. I've got five tons of top shelf drugs that I need delivered. Would do it myself, but I'm not in any state to fly, and my ship is - if you'll believe it - in even worse shape." The former ship-owner raises carefully raises an open pill bottle to his mouth, shakes a few capsules onto his tongue, and grinds them to powder with his teeth. There's a shiver and a grunt and a wheeze, and then he's back to relaxed.`

			`	"Hey, well, screw you too dude. But at least I'll be safe behind bars." There's a mellow sort of smile on the smuggler's lips as he resigns himself to his fate; one watery eye, a burnt body, and a bloodstream full of narcotic painkillers have rendered him helpless, and he knows it.`
			`	Spaceport security proves brusque but polite enough, but by the time you return to your ship somebody has spraypainted "Snitch" across the hull. Could that really have been the smuggler's work? His hands were barely functional, and this paint has been applied quite cleanly by the standards of graffiti.`

			`Junior - the smuggler you've brought on board - has become increasingly surly with every day you spend in space. He'd burnt through his supply of pills, and then finally whatever painkillers he was able to scrounge from your first aid cabinets. When you land at the warehouse he stomps down the gangway, grunts something incoherent towards you - a farewell? - and then brushes past some dangerous-looking workers. You try to follow, only to be rebuffed by the Lightspeed employees guarding the exit to your spacedock.`
			`	"We know him. We don't know you. You wait there." Any attempts at getting information from the tight-lipped guards prove fruitless.`
			choice
				`	(You have little choice but to wait.)`
			`	Junior's return is heralded by the stomping of mechanical feet. He walks in behind a pair of longshoremen piloting power loaders, each one bearing a pallet loaded with lashed crates upon their hydraulic claws. The smuggler, apparently in a much brighter mood - and with pupils as wide as saucers - beckons you over. "My boys here will load the goods, in the mean time, you got any questions about how this whole smuggling business works? I can teach you how now to get caught. Which is, y'know, something I'd very much prefer not happen."`

			`	"Not getting scanned in the first place is your best defense. A heavily loaded bulk freighter is sure to get caught, but a small courier vessel can usually - usually - outrun police interdictors. Mind, they've started packing afterburners lately, so... Good luck, pal."`
			`	"Mixing up your cargo by transporting stuff like grain or metal or industrial equipment can sometimes throw off their scans and return false negatives. Any bulk commodity, really. Interference plating is great and makes that even more likely to happen, but it doesn't work on its own - it needs something to mix signals with."`
			`	"If you do get scanned and stopped, there's one of three ways it can go down. First, you simply accept the fine and surrender the cargo. Please don't do this? I'd rather not get whacked. If you're on your own job, though, sometimes it's better to just eat the fine once than pay a bunch of bribes because you're getting scanned over and over. Which brings us to the second option-"`
			`	"Good news is, most cops are just like you and me - out to make a buck and not too picky about how they do that. Paying them off is usually cheaper than whatever fine they decide to slap you with, and you'll get to keep your cargo. Just keep in mind that occasionally you'll run into an honest cop who won't take your bribe. And if you're not able or willing to bribe them, and you don't want to surrender your cargo, there's only one option left:"`
			`	"Run for it! This is going to seriously piss off the ISP and any Navy ships in the system, and might get interceptor fleets sent after anyone matching your description. But hey, at least you get to keep your payout at the end. Just lay low for a while and the ISP will usually cool down. Unless you're been shooting them down, that does tend to piss 'em off."`
				goto tutorialreturn
			label wrecked
			`	"It was the damn ISP, man. Really hate those guys - just my luck to run into the one honest cop in the whole region. He wouldn't take my bribe, and dumping cargo wasn't an option, so I ran- straight into a Navy blockade. Made it through, but landing got a bit fiery. And now here I am." Cracked lips attempt a smile.`

			label ed
			`	"What, you talking about Sleezy Ed? Ugh. I don't want to talk about that greaseball. Ask me again when I'm in a better mood." Considering the smuggler is currently sattelite-high on painkillers, your chances of finding him feeling any better than this are slim indeed - especially once the drugs wear off and he starts to feel his wounds again.`

			`	"Alright, friend. We're ready to leave. But while we're here... Why don't you visit the outfitter? If you've got the space, they can set you up with some interference plating. It'll help stretch out the signal of any masking cargo we're carrying. Or, if you're feeling gutsy, just ask for 'tickets to the season playoffs', they'll set you up with some boxes of counterfit creds. Ed always wants more of those, he'll pay a good sum. Just remember, the more legal cargo we carry the safer we'll be, so try to keep things balanced."`
