# We can merge this into the main smuggling/jobs/what-have-you .txt when it's done. Until then I'll keep it seperate for the sake of keeping it easy to edit.

# The flow is as follows:
#	1) You meet a smuggler who's down on his luck, and he asks for your help in delivering an illegal cargo
#	to Sleezy Ed's, as he owes Ed a great debt and is deathly afraid of winding up on the wrong side of the
#	otherwise jovial ship salesman.
#	While setting up for the journey (carrying a modest mission cargo), the smuggler suggests a few methods
#	for evading scans: Stay towards the fringes and carry a good amount of legal cargo to confuse police.
#	Ideally we'll have some code implemented that makes getting caught based on a ratio of legal:illegal
#	cargo carried.


#	2) Upon arriving at Sleezy Ed's you listen in on a conversation between the smuggler and Ed. He's off 
#	the hook, but still without a ship - so he asks for a ride to Copperline Station, where he has some
#	friends who'll get him running rum until he can afford to get his original ship restored.
#	In return, he'll show you some secret and help you make some profit running stolen ship parts to  Cprlne.

#	3) A waypoint is generated in an empty or modestly-patrolled system between your destination (Copperline)
#	and Sleezy Ed's. It was formerly a non-landable object, but now allows you to land and refuel from a
#	cache maintained by the smuggler's buddies. Upon landing you have a chance to talk to the smuggler and 
#	learn something about his history, about the rumrunners at Copperline, and about Ed's scrapyard.

#	4) Drop the smuggler off at Copperline and sell the stolen ship parts you picked up at Ed's. Tutorial
#	complete!

			`The landing pad next to yours is a hot mess - quite literally. Smoke still billows from fractures in a shot-up ship's hull while spaceport emergency crew dump fire suppressant foam through the larger gaps; your nose stings and eyes water with the acridity of burning electronics.`
			`	You disembark just in time to see a man shoo off medical staff, just as soon as they've finished winding bandages around his hands and face. His long coat is horribly scorched, seemingly having taken the brunt of whatever burnt his exposed skin. "And don't think I'll be paying for this! Never asked for it, you know!"` 
			`	The figure waits until the spaceport medics are properly shooed off before surreptitiously reaching into his coat and - with great care given his clearly burnt hands - fumbles out a small pill bottle and torturously wrenches open the child-proof cap. He's in clear agony until popping a few pills from the bottle into his jaw and promptly crushing them, sending a shiver through the man's frame followed by a decidedly relaxed slouch and sigh of relief.`

			label pilot
			`	"Boss is gonna' have me wiped if I don't deliver this cargo and settle a debt, so I might as well be forward with you - worst case scenario, you squeal and I'm safe in jail. Best case you help me and I get my life back. I've got five tons of top shelf drugs that I need delivered. Would do it myself, but you see the state of my ship and-" The former ship-owner raises his palms, shaking them in a jazz-hands maneuver. The skin around his wrists is in a hideous staet; you can only assume that under the bandages wrapping his palms and fingers it's just as bad.`
			`	"Will you help me move my cargo and give me a ride to Sleezy Ed's scrapyard? It's over in Naper. I'm... down on my luck at the moment, or I wouldn't be so open about this, but I'm a damn good smuggler and can teach you some tricks of the trade if you'll assist me."`
			`	"And before you say that a damn good smuggler shouldn't be in this situation to begin with, uh, I- I don't got anything to say about that, actually. Just do me a solid?"`
			choice
				`	"I'm not very keen on breaking the law, but I also can't just leave you to your fate. I'll do what you need."`
				`	"Honest trade sure doesn't pay as much as I'd like, maybe it's time for a career change. Teach me your ways, wise master."`

			label accept
			`	"You'll see! It'll be very worth the time and effort. Just don't get caught and land us both in the slammer, yeah buddy? Now, I ditched my cargo in a field on the way here, but..." The wounded smuggler carefully withdraws his wallet. "I think I've got just enough credits left to round up some burly boys and have the goods manhandled onto your ship. You meet me at the spaceport when you're ready to go, and I'll impart my first set'a wisdoms."`
			choice
				`	(Kill some time, then check in at the spaceport.)`
			`	There he is, as promised, the smuggler's one un-bandaged eye barely focused as you're regarded through the haze of painkillers he's been downing. "Heyyyyyyyy, you showed up. Cool. Remind me what we're doing here again?"`

			`	"Not getting scanned in the first plcae is your best defense. A heavily loaded bulk freighter is sure to get caught, but a small courier vessel can usually - usually - outrun police interdictors. Mind, they've started packing afterburners lately, so... Good luck, pal."`
			`	"Mixing up your cargo by transporting stuff like grain or metal or industrial equipment can sometimes throw off their scans and return false negatives. Any bulk commodity, really. Interference plating is great and makes that even more likely to happen, but it doesn't work on its own - it needs something to mix signals with."`
			`	"If you do get scanned and stopped, there's one of three ways it can go down. First, you simply accept the fine and surrender the cargo. Please don't do this? I'd rather not get whacked. If you're on your own job, though, sometimes it's better to just eat the fine once than pay a bunch of bribes because you're getting scanned over and over. Which brings us to the second option-"`
			`	"Good news is, most cops are just like you and me - out to make a buck and not too picky about how they do that. Paying them off is usually cheaper than whatever fine they decide to slap you with, and you'll get to keep your cargo. Just keep in mind that occasionally you'll run into an honest cop who won't take your bribe. And if you're not able or willing to bribe them, and you don't want to surrender your cargo, there's only one option left:"`
			`	"Run for it! This is going to seriously piss off the ISP and any Navy ships in the system, and might get interceptor fleets sent after anyone matching your description. But hey, at least you get to keep your payout at the end. Just lay low for a while and the ISP will usually cool down. Unless you're been shooting them down, that does tend to piss 'em off."`

			`	"It was the damn ISP, man. Really hate those guys - just my luck to run into the one honest cop in the whole region. He wouldn't take my bribe, and dumping cargo wasn't an option, so I ran- straight into a Navy blockade. Made it through, but landing got a bit fiery. And now here I am." Cracked lips attempt a smile.`
				goto tutorialreturn
			label ed
			`	"What, Sleezy Ed? Ugh. I don't want to talk about that greaseball. Ask me again when I'm in a better mood." Considering the smuggler is currently sattelite-high on painkillers, you might doubt your chances of finding him feeling any better than this - especially once the drugs wear off and he starts to feel his burns again.`

			`	"Hey, well, screw you too dude. But at least I'll be safe behind bars." There's a mellow sort of smile on the smuggler's lips as he resigns himself to his fate; one watery eye, a burnt body, and a bloodstream full of narcotic painkillers have rendered him helpless, and he knows it.`
			`	Spaceport security proves brusque but polite enough, and by the time you return to your ship there's no sign of the smuggler - save for the fact that somebody has spraypainted "Snitch" on the side of your ship. Could that really have been the smuggler's work? His hands were barely functional, and this paint has been applied quite cleanly by the standards of graffiti.`

			`	You make your apologies and step away from the burnt smuggler. He seems momentarily bothered, but the contents of the pills he'd bitten into coursing through his blood have apparently left him too mellowed out to offer any unpleasant valedictions.`

			`	As promised, there's a gang of longshoremen waiting by your ship to load a few crates. They're looking a bit dented - probably from being shoved out an airlock at high speed - but the smuggler assures you that the contents are intact. "They have to be, because if they're not I'm screwed, yeah?" Certainly spotless logic.`
			`	"Let's get out of here. Next stop should be Sleezy Ed's, you'll find it in the east end of the Dirt Belt arm. Just make sure you don't end up in the Core by accident, totally different part of the galaxy. But hey! You're a space captain, you know this sort of thing. And, uh... Do be expedient. It's not like the delivery is time sensitive, but every moment you're out there is a moment you might get scanned by police, and every time you land customs might come calling. Try to make it in as few stops as possible."`
