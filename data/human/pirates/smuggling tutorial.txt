			`No spaceport is complete without somebody in dire straits asking passerby for help. This time the beggar is - from what you can see that isn't concealed by bandages - a young man scarcely beyond his teens, what of his skin remains visible marked by a painful looking pattern of burns. Both hands and the entire right half of his head are wound in bandages, and his entire body carries a strong odor of disinfectants and salve; not strictly unpleasant, but still bordering on the overpowering.

Best case you help me and I get my life back. I've got five tons of top shelf drugs that I need delivered. Would do it myself, but I'm not in any state to fly, and my ship is - if you'll believe it - in even worse shape." The former ship-owner raises carefully raises an open pill bottle to his mouth, shakes a few capsules onto his tongue, and grinds them to powder with his teeth. There's a shiver and a grunt and a wheeze, and then he's back to relaxed.`

			`	Spaceport security proves brusque but polite enough, but by the time you return to your ship somebody has spraypainted "Snitch" across the hull. Could that really have been the smuggler's work? His hands were barely functional, and this paint has been applied quite cleanly by the standards of graffiti.`

			`Junior - the smuggler you've brought on board - has become increasingly surly with every day you spend in space. He'd burnt through his supply of pills, and then finally whatever painkillers he was able to scrounge from your first aid cabinets. When you land at the warehouse he stomps down the gangway, grunts something incoherent towards you - a farewell? - and then brushes past some dangerous-looking workers. You try to follow, only to be rebuffed by the Lightspeed employees guarding the exit to your spacedock.`
			`	"We know him. We don't know you. You wait there." Any attempts at getting information from the tight-lipped guards prove fruitless.`
			choice
				`	(You have little choice but to wait.)`
			`	Junior's return is heralded by the stomping of mechanical feet. He walks in behind a pair of longshoremen piloting power loaders, each one bearing a pallet loaded with lashed crates upon their hydraulic claws. The smuggler, apparently in a much brighter mood - and with pupils as wide as saucers - beckons you over. "My boys here will load the goods, in the mean time, you got any questions about how this whole smuggling business works? I can teach you how now to get caught. Which is, y'know, something I'd very much prefer not happen."`

			`	"Mixing up your cargo by transporting stuff like grain or metal or industrial equipment can sometimes throw off their scans and return false negatives. Any bulk commodity, really. Interference plating is great and makes that even more likely to happen, but it doesn't work on its own - it needs something to mix signals with."`
			`	"If you do get scanned and stopped, there's one of three ways it can go down. First, you simply accept the fine and surrender the cargo. Please don't do this? I'd rather not get whacked. If you're on your own job, though, sometimes it's better to just eat the fine once than pay a bunch of bribes because you're getting scanned over and over. Which brings us to the second option-"`
			`	"Good news is, most cops are just like you and me - out to make a buck and not too picky about how they do that. Paying them off is usually cheaper than whatever fine they decide to slap you with, and you'll get to keep your cargo. Just keep in mind that occasionally you'll run into an honest cop who won't take your bribe. And if you're not able or willing to bribe them, and you don't want to surrender your cargo, there's only one option left:"`
			`	"Run for it! This is going to seriously piss off the ISP and any Navy ships in the system, and might get interceptor fleets sent after anyone matching your description. But hey, at least you get to keep your payout at the end. Just lay low for a while and the ISP will usually cool down. Unless you're been shooting them down, that does tend to piss 'em off."`

It'll help stretch out the signal of any masking cargo we're carrying. Or, if you're feeling gutsy, just ask for 'tickets to the season playoffs', they'll set you up with some boxes of counterfit creds. Ed always wants more of those, he'll pay a good sum. Just remember, the more legal cargo we carry the safer we'll be, so try to keep things balanced."`
